# Motion Types

Motion Types is a programing language developped by Nicolas Cannasse at [Motion Twin](https://motion-twin.com) in 2004-2005.

It was used internally at Motion Twin for developping web games.

[Haxe](https://haxe.org/) is the successor of Motion Types.

Motion Types can generate Flash 7 SWF or [neko](https://nekovm.org) bytecode.

This repository contains windows binaries of the compiler (mtypes.exe) and the standard library for Flash.
